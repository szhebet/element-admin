## 🚀 Getting started

This component is developed and maintained by [Element](https://element.io). It gets shipped as part of the **Element Server Suite (ESS)** which provides the official means of deployment.

ESS is a Matrix distribution from Element with focus on quality and ease of use. It ships a full Matrix stack tailored to the respective use case.

There are three editions of ESS:

- [ESS Community](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm) - the free Matrix distribution from Element tailored to small-/mid-scale, non-commercial community use cases
- [ESS Pro](https://element.io/server-suite/pro) - the commercial Matrix distribution from Element for professional use
- [ESS TI-M](https://element.io/server-suite/ti-messenger) - a special version of ESS Pro focused on the requirements of TI-Messenger Pro and ePA as specified by the German National Digital Health Agency Gematik

## 📝 Prerequisites and standalone installation

Element Admin is designed to work with the components that ship with [ESS](https://element.io/en/server-suite).
It assumes the following, which is **handled out of the box by ESS version 25.9.2 or later**:

- A [Synapse](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse) instance and [its admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/reverse_proxy.html#synapse-administration-endpoints) accessible
- A [Matrix Authentication Service](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service) instance with [its admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/topics/admin-api.html#enabling-the-api) accessible
- An domain name with a valid SSL certificate (HTTPS) where to host Element Admin. It _must_ be served from a secure context, as required by the next-generation auth Matrix APIs.

Under the hood, Element Admin is a single-page application React application which can be deployed in any static hosting service or container environment.
